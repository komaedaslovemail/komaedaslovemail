  <!-- Write a brief description about yourself here -->
  Just a few things I'd like to add to avoid unpleasant encounters
  on ponytown i guess (knowing damn well I don't like socializing nor
  anyone would try to interact with me on a daily basis)

  # Attitude/Personality
   ### -Rude people
  yeah self explanatory!
  ### - Freaky people
  umm just don't over do it then it's completely fine

  # Gameplay
  ### - Copy?
  Uhh no copies are a big no no, unless ofc i gifted you a pony, but I'm fine with inspos
  its just ponies not that big of a deal but do let me know if you will take inspo I'd 
  be happy to share my works with you guys
  ### - C+H
  Yes.

  # Fandoms
  ### - None!
  Any fandom feel free to int!!
